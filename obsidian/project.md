# The LinAlg Project
This project is meant to create a simple and functional linear algebra library. [[Features]] shall include matrices, vectors, addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinants, elimination algorithms.
I will also have a review/study of potential [[sources]] I find and learn from. This is because I am admittedly unlearned in writing a C++ library, along with having more or less a solid foundation of C++ without much practice on top. I can read and understand a section of code well enough, but I haven't written my own code well enough to argue for why a function should or shouldn't be inline, constexpr, etc. 
Topics of discussion would be programmatic representation of the data for the matrices and vectors, along with elimination algorithms and identifying pivot positions, columns, and rows.
A bonus feature would be the ability to write a system of linear equations in their respective matrix/vector form and parametric form
