# This is the root of my project's notes
## Why Obsidian?
Although I tend to use LaTeX as a note-and-reference-keeping tool, I agree with Obsidian's philosophy of  how one should organize notes and thoughts. It is more in-keeping with how the brain keeps thoughts and ideas in a sort of relational map, rather than a linear set of "if this then that" thoughts. So for this project, I will see about using Obsidian to keep a majority of my notes, whilst LaTeX will be used as a sort of overall overview

## How Obsidian?
Well it's simple, really. I will have a bunch of notes organized around a central entry, such as [[project]], and these bunches of notes may or may not have several more bunches of notes organized around them. This will all be related to the project itself.
Something I'd want to be able to is insert images into the notes. This means I can inject handwritten equations. Will have to look into this.
